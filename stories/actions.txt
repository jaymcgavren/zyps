Story: Approaching a target
	As a user
	I want to add an approach action to a creature
	so that it will move toward its target
	
	Scenario: starting from a standstill
		Given an environment
		And a creature at "0", "0"
		And a new behavior
		And an approach action initialized with a rate of "1"
		And a game object at "1", "1"
		When "0.1" seconds elapse
		Then the creature's speed should be "0.1"
		And the creature's angle should be "45"
Story: Starting/stopping actions
	As a developer
	I want to define what actions will do when they start or stop
	So that I can have them play sounds or provide other indicators the state is changing
	Scenario: Starting an action
		Given an environment
		Given a creature
		And a behavior
		And a tag action with a tag of "foo"
		When the tag action is added to the behavior
		And the behavior is added to the creature
		And the environment interacts
		Then start() should be called on the tag action
		And do() should be called on the tag action
		And stop() should NOT be called on the tag action
