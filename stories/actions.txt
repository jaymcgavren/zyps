Story: Approaching a target
  As a user
  I want to add an approach action to a creature
  so that it will move toward its target
  Scenario: starting from a standstill
    Given an environment
    And a creature whose location is "0", "0"
    And a game object whose location is "1", "1"
    And a behavior
    And an approach action with a rate of "1"
    When the approach action is added to the behavior
    And the behavior is added to the creature
    And the creature is added to the environment
    And the game object is added to the environment
    And "0.1" seconds elapse
    And the environment interacts
    Then do() should be called on the approach action
    And the creature should have a vector with a speed of "0.1" and a pitch of "45"
Story: Starting/stopping actions
  As a developer
  I want to define what actions will do when they start or stop
  So that I can have them play sounds or provide other indicators the state is changing
  Scenario: Starting an action
    Given an environment
    Given a creature
    And a behavior
    And a tag action with a tag of "foo"
    When the tag action is added to the behavior
    And the behavior is added to the creature
    And the environment interacts
    Then start() should be called on the tag action
    And do() should be called on the tag action
    And stop() should not be called on the tag action
  Scenario: Stopping an action
    Given an environment
    Given a creature
    And a behavior
    And a tag action with a tag of "foo"
    And a tag condition with a tag of "bar"
    When the tag action is added to the behavior
    And the tag condition is added to the behavior
    And the behavior is added to the creature
    And the environment interacts
    Then start() should not be called on the tag action
    And do() should not be called on the tag action
    And stop() should be called on the tag action
