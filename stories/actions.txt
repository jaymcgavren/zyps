Story: Approaching a target
	As a user
	I want to add an approach action to a creature
	so that it will move toward its target
	Scenario: starting from a standstill
		Given an environment
		And a creature whose location is "0", "0"
		And a game object whose location is "1", "1"
		And a behavior
		And an approach action with a rate of "1"
		When the approach action is added to the behavior
		And the behavior is added to the creature
		And the creature is added to the environment
		And the game object is added to the environment
		And "0.1" seconds elapse
		And the environment interacts
		Then do() should be called on the approach action
		And the creature should have a vector with a speed of "0.1" and a pitch of "45"
Story: Starting/stopping actions
	As a developer
	I want to define what actions will do when they start or stop
	So that I can have them play sounds or provide other indicators the state is changing
	Scenario: Starting an action
		Given an environment
		Given a creature
		And a behavior
		And a tag action with a tag of "foo"
		When the tag action is added to the behavior
		And the behavior is added to the creature
		And the environment interacts
		Then start() should be called on the tag action
		And do() should be called on the tag action
		And stop() should not be called on the tag action
	Scenario: Stopping an action
		Given an environment
		Given a creature
		And a behavior
		And a tag action with a tag of "foo"
		And a tag condition with a tag of "bar"
		When the tag action is added to the behavior
		And the tag condition is added to the behavior
		And the behavior is added to the creature
		And the environment interacts
		Then start() should not be called on the tag action
		And do() should not be called on the tag action
		And stop() should be called on the tag action
