Story: Approaching a target
	As a user
	I want to add an approach action to a creature
	so that it will move toward its target
	
	Scenario: starting from a standstill
		Given an environment
		And a creature at "0", "0"
		And a new behavior
		And an approach action initialized with a rate of "1"
		And a game object at "1", "1"
		When "0.1" seconds elapse
		Then the creature's speed should be "0.1"
		And the creature's angle should be "45"
