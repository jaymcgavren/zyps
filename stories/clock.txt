Story: Pausing game
	As a user
	I want to be able to pause the game
	So that I can come back to it later
	Scenario: pausing the game
		Given an environment
		And a creature at "0", "0"
		And a vector with a speed of "4" and an angle of "150"
		When the global clock speed is set to "0"
		And the vector is assigned to the creature
		And "2" seconds elapse
		And the environment interacts
		Then the creature's location should be "0", "0"
	Scenario: resuming the game
		Given an environment
		And a creature at "0", "0"
		And a vector with a speed of "4" and an angle of "150"
		When the vector is assigned to the creature
		And the global clock speed is set to "0"
		And "1" second elapses
		And the environment interacts
		And the global clock speed is set to "1"
		And "1" second elapses
		And the environment interacts
		Then the creature's location should be "-3.464", "2"
Story: Speeding up game
	As a user
	I want to be able to speed up the game
	So that I don't have to wait through boring periods
	Scenario: Speeding up game
		Given an environment
		And a creature at "0", "0"
		And a vector with a speed of "4" and an angle of "150"
		When the vector is assigned to the creature
		And the global clock speed is set to "2"
		And "1" second elapses
		And the environment interacts
		Then the creature's location should be "-6.928", "4"
Story: Slowing down game
	As a user
	I want to be able to slow down the game
	So that I can keep up with fast action.
	Scenario: Slowing down game
		Given an environment
		And a creature at "0", "0"
		And a vector with a speed of "4" and an angle of "150"
		When the vector is assigned to the creature
		And the global clock speed is set to "0.5"
		And "1" second elapses
		And the environment interacts
		Then the creature's location should be "-1.732", "1"
Story: Speeding up one action
	As a user
	I want to be able to speed up one action
	So that I can act faster than other objects in the environment
	Scenario: Speeding up firing
		Given an environment
		And a creature
		And a behavior
		And a shoot action
		And an elapsed time condition of "2" seconds
		And a game object
		And a clock with a speed of "2"
		When the game object is added to the action's prototypes
		And the clock is assigned to the action
		And the action is assigned to the behavior
		And the condition is assigned to the behavior
		And the behavior is assigned to the creature
		And the creature is added to the environment
		And "1" second elapses
		And the environment interacts
		Then there should be "2" objects in the environment
	Scenario: Increased local AND global speed
		Given an environment
		And a creature
		And a behavior
		And a shoot action
		And an elapsed time condition of "4" seconds
		And a game object
		And a clock with a speed of "2"
		When the game object is added to the action's prototypes
		And the clock is assigned to the action
		And the action is assigned to the behavior
		And the condition is assigned to the behavior
		And the behavior is assigned to the creature
		And the creature is added to the environment
		And the global clock speed is set to "2"
		And "1" second elapses
		And the environment interacts
		Then there should be "2" objects in the environment
	Scenario: Normal-speed firing
		Given an environment
		And a creature
		And a behavior
		And a shoot action
		And an elapsed time condition of "2" seconds
		And a game object
		And a clock with a speed of "1"
		When the game object is added to the action's prototypes
		And the clock is assigned to the action
		And the action is assigned to the behavior
		And the condition is assigned to the behavior
		And the behavior is assigned to the creature
		And the creature is added to the environment
		And "1" second elapses
		And the environment interacts
		Then there should be "1" object in the environment
