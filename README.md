# Synopsis

Zyps - An AI library for building games.


# Description

Zyps are small creatures with minds of their own.  You can create dozens of Zyps, then decide how each will act.  (Will it run away from the others?  Follow them?  Eat them for lunch?)  You can combine rules and actions to create very complex behaviors.


# Installation

Make sure you have administrative privileges, then type the following at a command line:

    gem install zyps



# Usage

Ensure wxRuby is installed and working:

    gem install wxruby

At a command line, type:

    zyps_demo


# Development

Documentation available via [RubyDoc](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/zyps/0.7.2).

Once downloaded, change into the project directory.  For a list of targets, run:

    rake -T

To build a gem:

    rake

To see the demo:
    
    rake demo

To create a "doc" subdirectory with API documentation:

    rake rdoc

Also see "bin/zyps_demo" and the "spec" subfolder in the project directory for sample code.

Glen Franta, Scott McGinty, and so many other math, science, and computer science teachers whose names I've forgotten.  Nothing I do today would be possible without your efforts so long ago.
